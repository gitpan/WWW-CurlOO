=head1 NAME

WWW::CurlOO::Form - Form builder for WWW::CurlOO

=head1 WARNING

THIS MODULE IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPEMENT AND SOME INTERFACE MAY CHANGE YET.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use WWW::CurlOO::Form qw(:constants);

	my $form = WWW::CurlOO::Form->new();
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME() => $name,
		CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS() => $data
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME() => $filename,
		CURLFORM_FILE() => $filename
	);


	# most likely use:
	$easy->setopt( CURLOPT_HTTPPOST() => $form );

	# serialize
	my $serial = $form->get();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module lets you build multipart/form-data HTTP POST. When finished it can
be either supplied to WWW::CurlOO::Easy handle or serialized manually.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item CLASS->new( [BASE] )

Creates new WWW::CurlOO::Form object. If BASE is specified it will be used
as object base, otherwise an empty hash will be used. BASE must be a valid
reference which has not been blessed already. It will not be used by the
object.

=item OBJECT->add( CURLFORM_option => DATA, ... )

Adds new section to form object. See L<curl_formadd(3)> for more info.
B<WARNING: currently some option combination may crash your perl.>

Working options include: CURLFORM_COPYNAME, CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH,
CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH, CURLFORM_FILECONTENT,
CURLFORM_FILE, CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, CURLFORM_FILENAME.

Unlike in libcurl function, there is no need to add CURLFORM_END as the last
argument.

On error this method dies with message: "curl_formadd() failed: $CURLFORMcode\n",
where $CURLFORMcode is a decimal number.

Options CURLFORM_COPYNAME and CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS automatibally set
appropriate their length values (CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH and CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH
respectively) so there is no need to set length even if there is a NUL
character in the data. If you want to shorten the buffer CURLFORM_*LENGTH
options must be set inmediatelly after their CURLFORM_COPY* options, otherwise
an CURL_FORMADD_OPTION_TWICE exception will occur.

	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME() => "name",
		CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS() => "content\0binary"
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME() => "name",
		CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH() => 2,
		CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS() => "content",
		CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH() => 4,
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "htmlcode",
		CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, "<HTML></HTML>",
		CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, "text/html"
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "picture",
		CURLFORM_FILE, "my-face.jpg"
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "picture",
		CURLFORM_FILE, "my-face.jpg",
		CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, "image/jpeg"
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "picture",
		CURLFORM_FILE, "my-face.jpg",
		CURLFORM_FILE, "your-face.jpg",
	);
	$form->add(
		CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "filecontent",
		CURLFORM_FILECONTENT, ".bashrc"
	);


=item OBJECT->get( [BUFFER / FH / USERDATA], [CALLBACK] )

Use it to serialize the form object. Normally there is no need to use it
because WWW::CurlOO::Easy will serialize it while uploading data.

There are multiple ways to perform serialization:

=over

=item direct

With no arguments a scalar is returned.

	my $serial = $form->get();

=item write to file handle

If there is only one argument and it is a GLOB or a GLOB reference,
serialized contents will be written to that file handle.

	open my $file, ">", "post.txt";
	$form->get( $file );

=item write to buffer

If there is only one argument and it is writable, serialized contents
will be concatenated to it.

	my $serial;
	$form->get( $serial );

	# same as above
	$form->get( \$serial );

=item use a callback

With two arguments, second one must be a function that will be called for
serialization. First argument is a user data that will be passed to that
function.

The callback will receive three arguments: form object, data buffer and
user data. It must return the length of the data buffer, otherwise
serialization will be aborted.

	sub cb_serial
	{
		my ( $form, $data, $userdata ) = @_;

		# do anything you want

		return length $data;
	}
	$form->get( "userdata", \&cb_serial );
