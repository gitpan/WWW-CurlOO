This package is working, but still a lot has to change.


** TODO **

CurlOO:
+ added LIBCURL_ constants

Easy:
- review !
- test callback arguments just before perform (maybe only for default writers)
- write more documentation
x multiple options in setopt
  -- not a good idea
x allow calling duphandle as: CLASS->duphandle( $source_object, $newbase );
  -- can be reblessed easily

Form:
- test with Easy
- implement buffer options
- implement read callback
- write more documentation

Multi:
- write more documentation

Share:
- write more documentation
+ test and fix multi-thread operation
- fix leaking scalars in threads

tests:
- use some pure-perl http server, should do for most tests
- review and renumerate
- add more crash tests (remove last reference while performing,
  forced destrution, etc)
