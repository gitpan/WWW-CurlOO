This package is working, but still a lot has to change.


** TODO **

CurlOO:
+ added LIBCURL_ constants
- register _global_cleanup from xs somehow

Easy:
- test callback arguments just before perform (maybe only for default writers)
- write more documentation

Form:
- implement buffer options
- implement read callback
- write more documentation

Multi:
- write more documentation
- on destroy callback can resurrect multi object and destroy it recursively,
  which will segv

Share:
- write more documentation

tests:
- use some pure-perl http server, should do for most tests
- review and renumerate
- add more crash tests (remove last reference while performing,
  forced destrution, etc)
