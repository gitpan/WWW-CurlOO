This package is working, but still a lot has to change.


** TODO **

CurlOO:
+ added LIBCURL_ constants

Easy:
- review !
+ delay deaths
- test callback arguments just before perform (maybe only for default writers)
+ implement pause (curl_easy_pause)
+ implement reset (curl_easy_reset)
+ allow calling strerror as function
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation
- multiple options in setopt
+ duphandle must copy package name from source object
- allow calling duphandle as: CLASS->duphandle( $source_object, $newbase );
+ multi() getter
+ share() getter
+ maybe form() getter

Form:
- test with Easy
- implement buffer options
- implement read callback
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation

Multi:
+ remove all remaining easy handles when destroying multi
+ implement handles() -- lists all easy handles attached now
+ implement assign (curl_multi_assign)
+ remove remove_handle from info_read
+ allow calling strerror as function
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation
+ info_read() should return result as ..::Easy::Code

Share:
+ test with Easy
+ allow calling strerror as function
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation
- test and fix multi-thread operation

tests:
- use some pure-perl http server, should do for most tests
- review and renumerate
- add more crash tests (remove last reference while performing,
  forced destrution, etc)
